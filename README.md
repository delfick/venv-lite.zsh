# Andy's very mini virtualenvwrapper-ish zsh plugin

This is a super-lightweight sort-of-clone of [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/); it pretty much expects you to be using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) (though you don't *have* to), and because it's based on the [`venv` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), (creation) only works for python >= 3.3.

Anyway, see the comments in [`venv-lite.zsh`](venv-lite.zsh) for all you need to know.
